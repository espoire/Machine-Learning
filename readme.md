# Machine-Learning

This is a machine learning sandbox. I'm using it to learn about artificial neural networks, and build a JavaScript neural networks & machine learning library.

To use:
- Clone the repository.
- Adjust code to configure training/test run & optional export trained weights to file.
- Execute with Node.js.
