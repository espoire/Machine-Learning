# Machine-Learning

This is a machine learning sandbox. I'm using it to learn about artificial neural netwroks, and build a JavaScript neural netwroks & machine learning library.

To use:
- Visit https://espoire.github.io/Machine-Learning/.
- Open the browser JavaScript console (Ctrl+Shift+J in Chrome).
- Use the exposed global variables Network (the class) and network (an example instance, preconfigured wiuth weights to mimic an XOR gate).

Please refer to the usage examples in the console log.
